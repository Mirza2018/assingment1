                <p>When you are actively absorbing and transcribing the information from a lecture into notes, you are
                    much more likely to stay focused. Whether it is writing it down manually into a notebook, or typing
                    it out on your laptop, taking notes during a lecture will most certainly improve your attention
                    span. Additionally, taking notes will allow your brain to wrap itself around the information and
                    comprehend it better. Plus, you won't need to spend extra time making notes to revise later on as
                    you will already have a summarized version of the lecture by the end of it.</p>
